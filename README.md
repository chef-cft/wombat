# `Project Wombat`
`wombat` is a gem that builds and creates demo environments using cloud-specific deployment
tools like CloudFormation. The demo environments are comprised of instances built
from the included packer templates:

* Chef Server
* Chef Automate
* Chef Compliance
* _N_ Automate Build Node(s)
* _N_ Infrastructure Nodes
* _N_ Windows Workstation

Usage
------------

##### Download your Automate license key
Automate requires a valid license to activate successfully. **If you do
not have a license key, you can request one from your CHEF account
representative.**

You will need to have the `delivery.license` file present inside `packer/files/`
directory. (You may need to rename from `automate.license`)

##### Install and Configure ChefDK

Follow the instructions at https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html to install and configure ChefDK as your default version of Ruby.

##### Install Packer

Downloads are here: https://www.packer.io/downloads.html . Place in your path for direct execution.

##### Create a wombat.yml

Create a wombat.yml - there is an example `wombat.example.yml` for reference and easy copying

*NOTE:* workstation-passwd must meet the minimum Microsoft [Complexity Requirements](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh994562(v=ws.11).aspx)

*NOTE:* The `googlecompute` and `azure` builders exist but not all images will build nor is there deployment support for either at this time.

##### Build images with Packer

```
# build one or more templates
$ bin/wombat build [-o BUILDER] TEMPLATE [TEMPLATE2]

# build all templates (sequentially)
$ bin/wombat build [-o BUILDER]

# build all images (parallel)
$ bin/wombat build [-o BUILDER] --parallel
```

*NOTE:* If the builder is not provided it defaults to `amazon-ebs`

##### Deploy CloudFormation template

###### via AWS CloudFormation Web UI

Upload the created template from the `cloudformation` directory.

###### via CLI

```
# Deploy CloudFormation template
$ bin/wombat deploy --cloud aws STACK
==> Updating wombat.lock
==> Generate CloudFormation JSON: STACK.json
==> Creating CloudFormation stack
Created: arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:862552916454:stack/STACK/2160c580-713e-11e6-b392-50a686e4bb82
```

*NOTE:* If the cloud is not provided it defaults to `aws`

##### Login to Windows Workstation

```
# Get Windows Workstation(s) IP(s)
$ bin/wombat outputs STACK
WindowsWorkstation (i-xxxxxxxx) => XX.XXX.XX.XXX
```

From the AWS CloudFormation UI, select the Outputs tab for the desired stack.
Use an RDP compatible client to login to the workstation with the embedded credentials.
